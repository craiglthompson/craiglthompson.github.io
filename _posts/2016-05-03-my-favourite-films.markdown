<h1>Notebooks</h1>
I have notebooks scattered about my desk. Older ones get pushed out to the farthest edges like jetsam, making way for pristine white sheets. I recently became curious about these relics and started flicking through one from 2013. I can't stop myself reflexively recoiling from what 3 year ago me might have thought was important enough to preserve. Riffling through the black notebook a great big list of films I'd seen that year caught my eye, partly because it spanned a few pages in my minuscule squiggly cursive. I was clearly watching an alarming amount of films at this time, some weeks approaching 2 dozen. Whilst I now read books primarily this journey through film begun in earnest in 2010 with watching horror films for fun with friends. We'd always try and find something new and obscure to scare each other with. I still have fond memories of my Irish flatmates reaction to the finale of REC. I can enjoy any film as there's always a spark of creativity I can appreciate but from 2010 to 2013 I started to watch more challenging films. It's good to go back and take a look at what I was into in 2013.<br><br>

<h3>La Nouvelle Vague</h3>
French new wave cinema is one of my all time favourite periods of cinema. The founding writers of the french film publication <em>Cahiers du Cinéma</em>, Bazin, Truffaut, Godard et al were bored of the studio style period production films. The journal gained attention and vindication for the authors which led to revolution. The writers' laissez-faire criticisms and essays soon turned to greater ambitions leading to a generation of exciting film making; a new wave of French cinema. The films are marked by their energy, social or political message and avant-garde methods. <br>

My favourite films from the period are:

<li>1. François Truffaut (<em>dir</em>): <strong>Small Change, Day for Night, Jules and Jim, The 400 Blows</strong>, Stolen, Kisses, Bed and Board, Love on the run</li>
<li>2. Jean Luc Godard (<em>dir</em>): <strong>Band of Outsiders</strong>, Weekend, <strong>Breathless</strong>, Vivre Sa Vie, Contempt, Masculin Féminin, Alphaville</li>
<li>3. Chris Marker (<em>dir</em>): La jetée<li/>
<li>4. Louis Malle (<em>dir</em>): Au revoir les enfants, <strong>My Dinner with Andre, Zazie dans la Metro</strong>.</li>

<br>
P.S. If you like literature check out the similar literary movement 'Oulipo', writers include Raymond Quineau (writer of Zazie dans la Metro) and Italo Calvino. Also, Hitchcock-Truffaut book where Truffaut interviews Hitchcock over every film he made, its perfect reference when re-watching Hitchcock films.

<h3>Hirokazu Koreeda (<em>dir</em>)</h3>
The late film critic Roger Ebert set me on to Hirokazu Koreeda. His films include: <br><br>
<li>I Wish,</li>
<li><strong>Maborosi</strong> </li>
<li>Still Walking</li>
<li>After Life </li>
<li>Air Doll.</li>
<br>

<h3>Werner Herzog (<em>dir</em>)</h3>
Werner Herzog is a documentarian who goes to extraordinary lengths to capture the story he wants to tell on film. A lot has been said about the relationship with lead actor Klaus Kinski and the troubles on sets of films such as Fitzcarraldo. He has a large body of work, here are the ones I most enjoyed.<br><br>
<li><strong>Stroszek</strong></li>
<li>My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done</li>
<li><strong>Happy People: A Year in the Taiga</strong></li>
<li>Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans</li>
<li>Invincible. </li>
<br>
