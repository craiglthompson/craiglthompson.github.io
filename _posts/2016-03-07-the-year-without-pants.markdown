I like to read a lot of books but don't often talk about that, I do post them all to GoodReads though if you're interested in sharing some good books, or take a look at what I'm reading.<br>

What I'm currently reading:<br>

<ul>
<li>The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu. Brilliant SF set in communist 'Soviet' era China and wonderfully written and translated. The science fiction is extremely implausible and yet the theoretical physics is just about grounded enough in modern technology such as VR, computer science and radio waves, that it keeps some tether to reality; without which it would be bilge. </li><br>
<li>City on Fire by Garth Risk Hallberg. I keep coming back to this 900+ page epic 1st novel which is really good, could be edited down a little in my opinion.</li><br>
</ul><br>

The last books I read that were 'professional' or work related:<br>
<ul>
<li>How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carneige - A seminal book on how to to get along with people better and be a better person. It's a lot of common sense, good parenting will have given, however often lost by some people as they grow up. It's an important reminder to stay humble, gracious, and keep other people in mind.  </li><br>
<li>Creativity, Inc. by Ed Catmull - A great book about creativity and managing people but also a great story about how Disney and Pixar successfully merged two creatively different companies to the mutual benefit of both.  </li><br>
<li>The Year Without Pants by Scott Berkun - A year inside a radical company leading the way in open source and sustainable business models.</li><br><br>

The book I'm most excited about sharing is Scott Berkun’s: “The Year without Pants: WordPress.com and the Future of Work,”.
Burkun is a business writer who was invited by Matt Mullenweg, WordPress's creator to work inside the company for a year, and write a book about what makes WordPress so unique.<br><br>

As a professional working in WordPress Matt is a legendary figure in the web community and this book is super interesting to me for that reason alone. The story of how Mullenweg (...it seems strange to use surnames here so I'll use <strong>Matt</strong> (as in Photomatt his original moniker (oh, and the name of his for profit company Auto<strong>matt</strong>ic (and his awesome domain hack <a href="www.ma.tt">ma.tt</a>))) so, how Matt...) started WordPress from a then Google developer's open source side project for publishing photos is incredible. <br><br>

A keen photographer, Matt originally began using a photo publishing platform to share his own photo blog on, but soon forked -an open source term- his own version of the software and continued to develop it after the original Google developer went quiet and stopped updating it. There's a fun story from the book in which Matt is orchestrating the WordPress annual staff photo with a lot of preparation only to find Scott's Jetpack team were goofin' off so it had to be rescheduled to include them. The quick surge in WordPress popularity allowed Matt the chance to work with Sergey Brin, and eventually even recruited the original developer (and ex-Googler) of the photo publishing software, and quickly iterated on WordPress' first versions. The timing was right as Moveable Type, the biggest publishing platform at the time, changed their pricing model, leading to the beginning of WordPress's mass adoption. WordPress has never looked back and continues to put user needs above all else.<br><br>


WordPress grew and grew with the help of thousands of volunteer contributors around the world and remains a not-for-profit run by WordPress.org. Much of the book focuses on how WordPress has spun off a business which has a symbiotic partnership with WordPress.com. Automattic is the business which provides hosting on the WordPress.com infrastructure as well as other professional services to clients such as the BBC. Money from Automattic directly supports WordPress.com core development and WordPress's core development is supported by Automattic's success.<br><br>


All new starts at Automattic and WordPress begin by working to solve user problems as part of the 'Happiness Team'. A Happiness Engineer's job is to resolve user problems which forces new starts to learn about WordPress fast, in order to solve the issues. Scott Berkun the books author used to work for Microsoft in the heyday of Internet Explorer. He certainly has the experience to manage a team, which is what he's brought in to do at Automattic. Scott works with a team which ends up creating a lasting legacy in form of Jetpack. Jetpack is the most popular WordPress plugin and one I personally install on all my WordPress websites. The book gives an inside perspective to how the project came about, with IRC chat excerpts, in house blog posts and feedback and plenty more detail and process. Some critical steps include proving there is a desire from users, to share work internally across all teams, rapidly develop and ship a working product. Once a product is shipped, Jetpack being the perfect example, it may only have a few features, but by tracking how users interact, support tickets created, user feedback, the product can be developed iteratively and improved incrementally over time until it is the stalwart it is today.<br><br>


WordPress' values are as follows:

<ul><li><strong>Transparency</strong> - Discussions about bug fixes, features, and other changes are public.</li>
<li><strong>Meritocracy</strong> - Employees earn respect based on the contributions they make. Job titles aren’t very important. Automattic avoids hierarchy and bureaucracy, and services like HR and legal are in service of the creators.</li>
<li><strong>Longevity</strong> - As an open source product, WordPress can survive no matter what Automattic does with it; anyone can take the code and “fork” it to form a new version.</li>
</ul><br><br>


I'm extremely interested in WordPress' future as it takes a leap into the modern web application approach. Using javascript for more processes, using react and other technologies brought about by Facebook, Twitter and other Silicon Valley companies. I'm not sure how working practices will change in the next 10 years but one piece of advice from Scott's look at WordPress seems to be to embrace new technology and software, to integrate it, try and test it out, evaluate the benefit and adjust how you work accordingly. I myself experiment with many different software, some being used only once, others become invaluable. Having an open mind and willingness to meet change with optimism and continuously ask questions of ourselves and how we work is deeply important for staying relevant and productive. In a broader perspective it would also seem worth noting that WordPress employees all work on different computer set ups, operating systems, remotely, (some in curiously contorted positions), with different habits and ways of doing things. Rather than trying to stymie this WordPress encourages it and empowers its talented workforce with freedom and trust in order to create value for its user base.
<br><br>

I recommend this book to anyone working in WordPress development, software development and business. It's a very readable book by a great author. Burkun tells a great story and describes the people involved and events with a lot of personality.<br><br>
