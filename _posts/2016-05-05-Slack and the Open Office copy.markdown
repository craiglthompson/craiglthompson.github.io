What do every religion you can think of have in common? They have a written text that is a consistent bedrock.

Philosophy doesn't remain static in cultures and religious movements that do not have a religious text to keep things stable, it undermines the unified cultural narrative, causes tension and leads to bifurcation.  When writing the excellent The Wiseman’s Fear (Kingkiller Chronicle series) of fantasy books, author Patrick Rothfuss received some insightful feedback which changed a whole culture’s history. The Adem, a culture within the world of the book, live by an ancient philosophy called “Lethani”.  Research into ancient theologies showed that it was impossible for one culture to have a unified philosophy without deviation or changes creeping in which is why so many fail and do not stand the test of time.

The trick is to introduce a text, or holy book; the Adem’s Bible. Rothfuss introduced this into the fiction through the Adem’s nine and ninety instructive tales. They serve as the touchstone of consistency and endurance for the philosophy adding to the consistency of the world, and the milieu.

As a designer this got me thinking. What would be design’s holy book?

One that comes close is a book I’ve recently finished which is twenty short of the ninety-nine instructive tales the Adem have. I like to think it leaves room for future designers to write twenty more instructive essays, after all design is a shifting —not yet matured— career.

<strong>Michael Bierut - Seventy-nine Short Essays on Design</strong>

Beirut offers anecdotal stories that communicate the culture of design rather than the practice of designing itself.

<em>" There is no pretending to understand the Lethani. It is like swimming. It is obvious to anyone watching if you really know the way of it." </em>- from the Kingkiller Chronicle

Bierut's book concerns itself more with the hard to communicate culture of design which as a young designer it’s possible to feel like an imposter and that you don’t ‘feel the way of it’.

This book won’t improve your graphic design skills when you’re through. What it can do is provide insight into the sort of thoughts that go through the mind of a designer who really knows what he's doing, and I think that’s valuable, especially to new designers.

It’s not easy to learn design and we more often than not have to seek out information and tutorials through our deep desire and passion to figure things out. So it’s actually very helpful to have a book or two to hand someone which speaks to the culture of design and helps keep the best practices and hard to define elements in circulation within the design communnity.

This is definitely one of my go to book recommendations for young designers without much experience.
