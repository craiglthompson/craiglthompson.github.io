<a href="http://www.tgat.org.uk/" title="The GORSE Academies Trust's website" alt="visit The GORSE Academies Trust's website">The GORSE Academies Trust</a> is undergoing a digital transformation. Websites have moved to the open source CMS WordPress and teams have adopted a variety of task management software. However, between Asana, Wrike, Zendesk, Trello, Whats App, Google Analytics, it all got a bit confusing.

<h3>The solution</h3>

Slack. Slack’s genius is in pulling in all these disparate push notifications into one manageable interface which revolves around efficient communication. As part of the newly formed TGAT Creative Team, it was important to establish a work flow and immediately Slack stood out because of how amazing it works with Trello and its potential to work with Asana.

<h3>All aboard</h3>

Slack is an easy sell when it comes to housing all of the task management and productivity apps' feeds under one roof, but it’s also delightful to use which makes for much speedier adoption. A lot of the DNA of a team can be translated into the app so that even working remotely no-one is left out. For example we have taken advantage of slack’s custom emojis which let users upload 128px images as custom emoji to add our faces as emoji, this is just one neat little trick that personalises the experience and gets everyone on board.

<h3>Intergrations</h3>

Integrations in Slack are the connections made to third-party software services such as Trello by installing an app in Slack. Apps extend the functionality of Slack and can receive push notifications into designated Slack channels to create a feed of the real time data and announcements you don’t want your team to miss.
<br><br>
Here are the integrations I have currently set up which actually takes us to the limit of integrations on the ‘free’ plan.
<br>

<li>1. <span style="color: #88d1d3"><strong>Convergely</strong></span> can schedule messages, set up out of office auto responds, and to send out quick polls to get yes / no answers.</li>
<li>2. <span style="color: #88d1d3"><strong>Statsbot</strong></span> pulls in the Google Analytics data for our (currently) 9 websites with GA. You can schedule reports and make queries directly in Slack chat using ‘/statsbot’ commands which return data including charts from Google directly into your Slack. I can’t emphasise enough <em style="color: #ed0d69">this feels like magic</em>. Also, tracks Adwords campaigns telling you how many people are clicking through from Google in realtime.</li>
<li>3. <span style="color: #88d1d3"><strong>Updown.io</strong></span> is <em style="color: #ed0d69">more magic</em>. This is built by a heroic French developer who’s goal is to provide good looking, simple, affordable up/down-time monitoring in Slack and put a smile on your face too. Highly recommend, there is a cost but for our websites we're covered for a year for only ~£30.</li>
<li>4. <span style="color: #88d1d3"><strong>Trello</strong></span> the most common boards we have at the moment are the fonts board and knowledge board and roadmaps. These are regularly updated and each change such as an image attached to the fonts board pulls through into the ‘#Trello-fonts’ Slack channel for example.
<li>5. <span style="color: #88d1d3"><strong>Zendesk</strong></span> Zendesk is the support hub where requests for website changes and IT support are logged for the helpful team to solve. These can be pulled into Slack so that no-one misses an important request.</li>
<li>6. <span style="color: #88d1d3"><strong>Giphy</strong></span> everyone should post a GIF in the Random slack channel as part of their Slack initiation. Typing ‘/giphy money’ for example will search the GIF database for GIFs tagged with the keyword ‘money’ and post one randomly into chat. It can lead to the most amazing places and should be reserved for maximum impact, we don’t feel the need to post these often but if you have colleagues who are going to abuse this it might be worth leaving this integration out. But I love it.</li>
<li>7. <span style="color: #88d1d3"><strong>Asana</strong></span> is task management for projects and teams. It has really seamless integration with Slack with a number of /asana commands to use in chat. You can receive updates when a task is created, completed, or commented upon. </li>
<li>8. <span style="color: #88d1d3"><strong>Slash Photos</strong></span> works a lot like /giphy except the command is /photo. It pulls photos with the keyword from Unsplash (which I love) and other free HQ stock photo sites. </li>

<h3>What does it mean?</h3>
Slack streamlines communication by removing the walls between the various online services we use. Having all of these streams of essential knowledge free and open to everyone is a great improvement in efficiency. It is perhaps a more perfect realisation of <a href="http://www.gaetanopesce.com" title="Gaetano Pesce’s Website" alt="Go to Gaetano Pesce’s website">Gaetano Pesce’s</a> open office design for TBWA\Chiat\Day in 1991. Open plan offices quickly proliferated and have improved communication and efficiency, however they lacked the ability for privacy, with people seeking quiet refuge in conference rooms and stairwells. Slack’s private channels are privacy at the drop of a hat, need to change location? Slack is making remote working from any location more viable than it ever has been. Slack isn’t a revolutionary leap in office functioning but it’s a refinement of Gaetano’s vision which facilitates communication and creates a happy environment within our technology driven workflows.

<h3>What’s next?</h3>

After setting up a TGAT Spotify account I’ve shared some playlists in to a #design-playlists channel, once we go pro and have more integrations available I will definitely check out the Spotify options. I would also like to see whether the good folks over at ithemes Security and ithemes Sync can offer any kind of Slack integration to really sweeten the deal as this is currently done rather circuitously through IFTTT and Outlook.
<br><br>
It’s necessary to track design jobs through tickets in Zendesk, however Slack is better than Zendesk for communication. It is much easier to share revisions of a design in a slack channel as there is less guilt than when you are sending an email to someone’s inbox and everyone cc’d on the ticket on a per revision basis. Slacks ‘everything’ search also makes finding and retrieving shared items and documents easy in the future. One final benefit is the ability for team members and clients to both upload inspiration which shapes the direction of the product, and images are dealt with and presented in a more approachable way. Once invited into a channel as a guest for a particular project ideas can be shared, with clients being involved in the conversation from the very beginning and free to participate as much, or little, as they’d like. One caveat is the need to become familiar with Slack, somewhat alleviated by its seamless experience between all devices.
