Prototyping is a great way to quickly present design ideas in an immidiate and engaging way. I like to get feedback as early as possible.<br><br />
Through protoyping we can get the fundamentals down:<br>
<ul>
<li>What goes in the menu?</li>
<li>What does the content hierarchy look like?</li>
<li>Sketch the user experience - what goals are people trying to accomplish and how are the getting around the site? A little empathy goes a long way.</li>
</ul><br><br />
<strong>The tools I like to use are:</strong> Pen and paper, Photoshop, Invision, Bootstrap, custom made card sorting index cards.<br><br />
The steps differ on projects but it would usually go roughly something like this:<br>
<ul>
<li>1. List out what we think users are going to do, talk to people and build up some empathy</li>
<li>2. Begin listing pages, structuring menus and information architecture. We want visitors to do what they came for quick and clean</li>
<li>3. Set out the top menu items and dropdown items in colour coded index cards. Smush those cards all over an epic table and get organisation staff to debate and order the cards logically</li>
<li>4. Create a site map</li>
<li>5. Lets start prototyping, gathering feedback, and iterating on what we have. I try to think about how it's working and listen to feedback which can push the direction of the project. I try to prototype in code as this is reusable - that CSS can be copied over, those styles aren't thrown out. If I want to throw out a number of designs Invision is great for turning my PDFs in to a fully interactive site.<br><br />
