Every project I work on starts with research, getting on the web and talking to people which starts a process of discovery.<br /> 

It's important to lay a good solid foundation for the project by using the story of the organisation and people at the heart of it.<br />

<ul>
<li>What shows up in an image search? I start to plan ahead, collect information and develop.</li><br>
<li>Talk to people and see what I can learn and mine from the local history to fuel the designs.</li><br>
<li>What other organisations are doing.</li><br>
</ul>
