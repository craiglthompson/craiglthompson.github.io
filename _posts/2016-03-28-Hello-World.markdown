<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>This is the very first sentence I am writing in the dedicated writing app I just bought from the app store. I want to talk about it a bit and share my initial I experience writing with it. </p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>I am long winded. I rely on editing, nothing i wrote ever got past an English teacher without coming back with <em>be more succinct</em> written indelibly — and carbon copied to my mind’s eye. The trouble is it’s easy to fall into old habits; regress, and in my case ease into meandering ramble for a thousand words. I’m also short of time  and so easily tempted to quickly blog out an article. I would always find what I’d written to be full of errors, lacking continuity, and breaking the divine rule <strong>thou shalt</strong><em>be more succinct</em>. </p>

<h2>My Solution</h2>

<p>Technology. If I’m going to invest my time into something it makes sense to invest finances to the pursuit also. There are a number of reasons this makes sense:</p>

<ol>
	<li>I enjoy it <em>and it helps me learn new things and share them with others</em></li>
	<li>I should remove obstacles such as crappy hardware and software</li>
	<li>Double down — Investing both time and money concentrates my commitment.</li>
</ol>

<p>This has been proven to work for me in the past. I bought a Mac to boost my efficiency in work, despite being a life long PC user and the eye watering price tag. And the result is that I want to spend more time on work, as the hardware is a joy to use, I don’t get distracted by PC problems, and I get more done.</p>

<h2>Ulysses </h2>

<p>The app I chose is premium, spending money on things you really need to improve your output and happiness are green light buys with no regret in my opinion. At £35 it’s hardly a splurge, much cheaper than Word for example.</p>

<p>This app is dedicated to writing. As a designer I <strong>love</strong> it’s simplicity, use of default apple styles, keyboard shortcuts, and seamless integration with iCloud. It’s a joy to use as it takes care of everything leaving me to write and publish.</p>

<h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<p>My favourite feature of Ulysses is the simple keyboard shortcuts. For example pressing Command+9 reveals the markup commands to automatically apply styles to titles and lists. When exported as a web page this is super handy.</p>

<p>Here is a list <em>(but not a full one)</em>of the markup:</p>

<ul>
	<li>‘#’ Heading 1</li>
	<li>‘##’ Heading 2 this continues up to ‘######’ Heading 6</li>
	<li>‘%%’ Comment block</li>
	<li>‘ “ ‘ Code block</li>
	<li>‘----’ Divider</li>
	<li>‘1.’ Ordered list</li>
	<li>‘-‘ Unordered list</li>
	<li>‘&gt;’ Blockquote</li>
</ul>

<p>These are incredibly intuitive to use and will save me time and effort; it has been well worth getting familiar with them which i’ve managed to do whilst writing this first post. </p>

<p>There are other benefits to the app. One being that the value significantly increases if like me you have multiple Apple devices you could write on. My iPad Pro for example with it’s keyboard dock is a perfect lightweight travel companion. I can see myself using the Ulysses-iPad Pro combo, as I take it with me more often than my Macbook, e.g., on the train. </p>

<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>

<p>Writing blog posts in Atom, the text editor I use to write HTML, was not a good process. My blog is hosted on Github and so updating the website with multiple commits to fix spelling mistakes is embarrassing and time consuming.  Working with Ulysses has freed me up to concentrate on the writing and is a happier and better way to work, which means I’ll be doing more of it going forward. </p>
