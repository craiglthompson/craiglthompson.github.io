Even when I have no idea how to solve a problem, after a couple of minutes putting pen to paper - stuff starts to happen.<br><br />
All of the ideas and knowledge seems to percolate out through the nib of the pen and on to the paper. <br><br />
This process happens just the same in Illustrator or Photoshop. In Illustrator I can copy and paste a group, play around and just see what happens.<br><br />
Sketching is  about exploration and play, it is the perfect way to encourage new ways of thinking and solving problems.<br><br />
