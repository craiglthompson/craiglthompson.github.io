So far in my career as a designer I’ve always understood the collaborative nature of design and enjoy working towards the best solution to creative problems. Getting to the best solution is often the culmination of numerous people coming together and having a say. 

Working in an organisation with lots of diversity and differences in approach often there are too many good ideas proposed and no definitive answer as to which is best. What should be done in that situation, when discussions become circulatory in a time pressured environment? 

I use empathy for the target audience of a design, as well as the points of view of everyone involved along the way to help inform whether I should hold on to my opinion or give way to a different approach. When this doesn’t work and progress halts as we endlessly campaign and insist that one way is the right way; designer Cap Watkins has a simple mantra to dislodge debates like this.

Cap’s approach came about naturally during such a standstill.

\<em\>“Hold on a second. I’m like a two-out-of-ten on this. How strongly do you feel?
I’m probably a six-out-of-ten, I replied after a couple moments of consideration.
Cool, then let’s do it your way.”\</em\>

It’s that simple. It works on the premise that you’re both awesome individuals brought in to the organisation to do great work and you both have a solution that will benefit the organisation. So, who is most passionate about their solution being used to solve this problem? This approach helps create distance from the reactionary response, replacing it with a distanced analytical approach. Aggregating you’re feelings into a digit in this way diffuses the emotion and clears the way for a quick, decisive mutual answer to the problem, allowing progress to be resumed with no hard feelings.

Rating decisions on that same one-to-ten scale helps identify non-critical decisions I don’t actually care that much about one way or another. I’ll still voice my opinion, this time with “I’m a two-out-of-ten on this, so whatever you want to do is fine.” If the project has far-reaching effects then l might stand by my approach and fight for it a bit more.

One benefit in this approach is discovering how frequently the thing you would normally stubbornly insist on and debate, actually rates low on your scale, and this extends out of work too, into daily decisions and life choices. I also now feel more attuned to my own feelings about decisions and similarly can read others’ better. Which can help me decide about whether the project is important to me or whether someone else has a drive and passion for a project which would benefit from their method. When you acquiesce on matters in this way then you also build up respect and trust with your colleagues who will respect your opinion even more when you do stand up for something.
