This weekend my brother and I ran in another half marathon together, our 4th as a team and my first on foreign soil. My form has been excellent, setting new and faster times with every race I entered. So when I arrived in Jedburgh the expectation was to get another personal best and potentially get under 1 hour 3 0 minutes for the first time. 
 
We set off with high spirits in my brother’s dark blue Ford Focus, steamed up from our presence — both a sign of Winter’s chill and the otiose air conditioning. We were headed to Jedburgh’s running festival in Scotland and so naturally we headed up, up the motorway we went, the Sat Nav confirming our progress up the map, huge signs reading ‘THE NORTH’ further reaffarming our upwards trajectory.

Everything about the race suggested that my preparation would pay off. Perfect weather, no wind — which can be a real problem during Jedburgh’s half marathon adding on minutes to runners’ times — and I’d had months of solid preparation leading up to this race, all the cards were lining up.

We did our warm up run on a loop of the last 3 km of the race and I felt good. As we lined up on the start line a drum beat which had until now gone unnoticed, established itself — a low, deep and steady rhythm which underscored the thronging excitement.  I got the impression of a large yet underdog band of soldiers hidden behind tree cover, waiting for the signal to charge out and confront our destinies. And in the shadow of Jedburgh castle we all rose to the challenge at 11:00 AM when the race began and 330 half marathon runners started their own personal battles.

I was off to a good start but at the 5 km mark I let my breathing become too shallow for the level of effort I was putting in and I got a stitch. I knew this would not go away quickly and my best shot was to slow down and recover and then try to make back the time. As my pace dropped by over a minute per kilometre all sorts of thoughts went through my head, from stopping, to running the rest of the race at this slower training pace, to fading out of existence in a blush of shame. In the end the stitch lasted 3 km and I did up my pace by a minute / km, but those 3 minutes were still lost.  All I could do was shut it out of my mind and try and get a respectable time.

I embarked on the familiar final few kilometres strongly and as I screamed past broken men who’d run themselves flat on a mad 200m sprint finish I realised I hadn’t been able to give it my all and still had plenty left in the tank. I was disappointed I’d not ran myself flat breaking 1 hour 30 minutes, and knew I had it in me, but all I can do is look for a silver lining. And what I learned from this race is that accepting emergent setbacks with pragmatism and reframing my objective around the new reality can relieve the panic and stress, and still deliver a time just 3 minutes slower than my personal best time, which is far better in retrospect than it feels in the moment. 

I had to mentally adjust to take that 1 minute penalty for as many kilometres as it took to subside, the alternative was pushing on at the same pace and through the pain, which had a very high chance of worsening the situation - leading to me walking for a few kilometres. Framing the setback as an opportunity to bounce back with a strong second half helped recover a respectable time. 

This experience has helped me understand that no matter how big a problem appears, or how much pressure it can add to a situation, clear thinking, a broader view, re-assessment and adjusted expectations can still deliver a good result. It’s the end of my running season and looking back at the year I started running properly in January and did my first half marathon in April. I’ve since knocked 13 minutes off that time, and knocked about a minute and a half off my Park Run 5k time too. It’s been a fun year of running and there’s plenty to strive for next year, when I’m sure I’ll get a sub 1:30:00 half marathon and sub 20:00 Park Run. Bring on 2017!
