Hi. I'm Craig Thompson! Welcome to my blog.
<br /><br />
I am an experienced and successful designer, organiser, researcher, I have an academic background in Human Computer Interaction and User Experience Design. I create websites and digitally connected interactions that are focused on user needs.
<br /><br />
I transitioned into working for exciting not-for-profit organisations, helping them achieve their goals and improve their web services. I have worked for the charity <a title="LEARN.ORG.UK Limited" href="http://www.2learn.org.uk">LEARN.ORG.UK</a> Limited (a charity helping disadvantaged and British minorities advance their education and get jobs), creating the brand identity, corporate stationary, website, and establishing a social media presence.
<br /><br />
At <a title="The GORSE Academies Trust" href="http://www.tgat.org.uk/">The GORSE Academies Trust</a>, a large multi-academy trust in Leeds, United kingdom, I helped design, develop, and maintain the websites of the Trust's schools. I worked with key staff members to deliver excellent websites using the latest web techniques and technologies to display information in a fun and informative way.
<br /><br />
I currently live in Mirfield, Yorkshire, in the United Kingdom. As well as being the birth place of Sir Patrick Stewart, Mirfield is also a beautiful place to walk the dog, cycle, and run.
<br /><br />
